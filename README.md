# Diabetes Prediction Model
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that implements a machine learning model for predicting diabetes. The model is built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn.

## Dataset
- The model is trained on the [Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set).
- The dataset consists of various features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, etc., which are used to predict the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Model
- The model is based on a supervised learning algorithm called Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that aims to find an optimal hyperplane to separate data points of different classes.

## Usage
1. Download the [Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set).
2. Place the dataset file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in this repository.
4. Run the notebook to train the model and make predictions on new data.

## Requirements
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- scikit-learn (version 0.24 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- The results can be viewed and analyzed within the Jupyter Notebook.
